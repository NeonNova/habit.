## 🙏 Acknowledgements

- This project was born out of a personal desire to boost productivity during the summer while simultaneously honing my development skills.
- Significant inspiration was drawn from the Streaks app, available on Apple platforms. Their intuitive design and functionality served as a great reference point.
- The color scheme and overall aesthetic are inspired by my favorite Monkeytype theme, Iceberg-light, bringing a touch of familiarity and personal preference to the project.
